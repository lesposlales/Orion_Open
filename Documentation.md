# Orion Open library Documentation
This library is an exact one to one replica of the original Orion Library found here: https://github.com/shlexware/Orion

All documentation from the original library still apply, but the following has been removed from this verison:

```
Removed Color Picker
Removed Premium Features
Removed Config Features
Removed Init() Function (Previously required)
Removed Flags
```

Other then the above mentioned features, everything else is replicated to the best of my ability.
